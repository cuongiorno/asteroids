# To-do list
## Goal:
- [x]    Create a player ship. The ship should be able to rotate and thrust. Thrust will accelerate the ship “forward” in the direction that it is facing.
- [x]    Add bullets. The player ship will fire in the direction that it is facing. Bullets will disappear after a short while.
- [x]    Create three sizes of asteroids.
	- [x]        Asteroids will break into smaller asteroids when shot (The smallest will disappear when shot).
	- [x]        Asteroids will drift around until they are shot or they collide with the player. If the player collides with an asteroid, they will lose a life.
- [x]    Enable screen wrapping. (Objects leaving the top of the screen should enter the bottom, for example)
- [x]    Add menus and UI.
- [x]    Add sound effects and particle effects.

## Stretch goal:
- [ ]    Add a flying saucer that enters the screen and shoots at the player from time to time. The saucer should generally aim towards the player, but shouldn’t have too good of aim!
- [x]    Add a “hyperspace warp” that moves the player to a random part of the screen. The warp is a last-ditch attempt to dodge an asteroid, but it could place you in a worse predicament!
- [x]    Make it your own - This is a great game to add some custom power-ups to.
